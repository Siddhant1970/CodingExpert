Still if you are short on time you must check out <b>Dynamic Programming Playlist and Recursion playlist </b>as well.The best thing about him is he solves questions sequentially and then using them developes logic for tougher questions so in short he shows how questions folow a trend and can be related with one another which is really helpful.He briefly talks about how to approach a question in an interview and considered a gem in the field of computer science.

His core sheet and Competetive Programming sheets contains quality questions from all topics. <b>I have personally solved his Competitive programming sheet</b> and I found it really helpful as takes into account all the topics with number of questions according to the importance of the particular topic.His sheets contains 180 questions and if you want more you can solve <b>Love Babbar's 450 questions sheet for dsa</b>

            This channel contains a lot of content but what I would recommend is dont go through all of them but only
            go for the Videos lectured by Sumeet sir (Sumeet Malik) . He has created over 100 videos on DP,Bit manipulation
            and on an average over 40-50 videos on all the topics so if you want to get through a particular topic completely
            provided you have time you can through them. If you are short on time take a look on his <b> Dp , Recursion and Bit manipulation playlists </b> atleast that too only the important questions. The good thing about his videos is they are long and if you have enough time this is the best channel you can refer to.

            <b>Mastering data structures and Algorithms using C and C++ </b> on Udemy is his legendary course for getting indepth knowledge of data structures and Algorithms. I have completed this course as well as and also seen his you tube videos and i rarely know anyone from computer science who hasn't already watched his videos as he goes to the basics and develop basic understanding of the topics.Students start their coding journey watching his playlist and so i would definately refer this to an absolute beginner

            If you are new into Competitive programming then this guy has a long course which covers all the basics as well as 
            advanced topics and its a complete package for a absoulte beginner in cp. Also his way of teaching is really good and 
            explanations of intutions and logics of topics are amazing. Although this course is big but it will surely provide 
            good understanding of topics.If you have done Data structures and Algorithms on a good level you can proceed to learn 
            only those topics that are exclusive to competitive programming. His Number theory videos are really great and you must check them out

            This is the by far the best channel you can get on you tube for development.If you are into web development he has a 101 video course containing <b>html css and javascript</b> and that is the best you can get on the you tube . Apart from development he has a course on langauges like C++ and also dsa and has also shared ways how to be good at coding . He has those crash courses of 2-3hr durations of react django and many more which is helpful if you have less time.

            Telusko is famous for its <b>Python and Javascript course</b>.If you are looking for a python course you can trust me on this and watch his python playlist and at the end of this playlist he also provided a overview of django as well. His javascript course along with jquery is also worth watching and if you want lesser video with as good a explanation you can refer this channel. A good thing about his channel is that his videos are short in duration and has a higher value content . I recommend you all to at least watch his python playlist and go through others as well if you have enough time.

            The best part about this channel is the live streams.There are various live streams and explanation of topics that
            students might find confusing.In these streams they go from basic to advanced level and is useful for students trying 
            to be better at competitive programming. These streams focuses on a single topic and are of 1-3hrs long in which popular questions are being solved along with intution as wella as the logic. I prefer students ti watch the streams of <b>binary lifting and meet in the middle</b> and more if you can invest your time.

            have done all the topics please consider watching <b>Dynamic Programing and Trees for competitive programing </b>
            from this channel.I have looked into a lot of playlists and this was really the best i have encountered. Even his
